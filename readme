I got a lot of frameworks on O/R mapping. Most of these are happened in run-time.
This project is aimed to do O/R mapping in compile time, and all O/R codes are replaced
with fine-tuned "native" codes.

In process..

1. Scala to MySQL will be the scratch environment. It will provides following features:
a. the grammar will stick to native SQL as much as possible, like LINQ
b. type-safe
c. easy to support other database


－－－－－－－－－－－－－－ words above are no-long in mind ----------------- 

Rule 0:
  We like anorm.
  
Rule 1:
  Generate entities case class, json formats, anorm parsers based on mysql tables, views, strore procedures.
  
Rule 2:
  Simeple APIs like:
  Object.save()
  Object.save("xx" -> any)
  Updatable.load[User](id)
  
Rule 3:
  You think SQL is complicate and tend to find an ORM, I would think your thinking is too complex and naive :-)
